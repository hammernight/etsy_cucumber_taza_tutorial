Feature: Etsy Advanced Search Functionality
  In order to show the advanced search functionality
  As a user
  I want to search for an item in a sub category

  Scenario Outline: Advanced Search for items in various categories that exist and don't exist
    Given I am searching on Etsy
    When I specify the "<Sub Category>" sub category
    And I search for "<Search Term>"
    Then I should see "<Search Results>" search results for "<Search Term>"
  Examples:
    | Sub Category | Search Term | Search Results |
    | Knitting     | hat         | some           |
    | Jewelry      | necklace    | some           |
    | Jewelry      | specdriver  | no             |

  Scenario: Misspelling a word corrects search automatically
    Given I am searching on Etsy
    When I specify the Knitting sub category
    And I search for "scalf"
    Then I should see some search results for "scarf"
    And I should see that the search was for "scarf" instead of "scalf"
