Feature: Etsy Cart Functionality
  In order to show the basic cart functionality
  As a user
  I want to add and remove items from the cart


  Scenario: Item can be added to then removed from cart
    Given I am on the Etsy cart page
    And that the cart is empty
    When an item is added to the cart
    Then the cart contains that item
    When I remove the item from the cart
    Then the cart is empty
